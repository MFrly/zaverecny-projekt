#Idea for my game comes from game called Kindergarten.
#Game will be 2D pixel art style game.
#Core Gameplay Elements of my game in pygame:

1.Daily Loop Structure
---------------------------------
The game is structured around repeating the same day (similar to a time loop). Each day offers new possibilities depending on the player's choices.

2.Branching Storylines & Choices
---------------------------------
The game heavily emphasizes player choice. Talking to different characters and choosing different options can drastically change the outcomes of each day.

3.Puzzle & Quest System
---------------------------------
Many actions are like mini-quests. You need to gather items, talk to specific people in the right order, and solve logic-based puzzles to progress.

4.Dark Humor & Tone
---------------------------------
Despite the childlike setting, the tone is dark and satirical. It deals with adult themes through absurd scenarios.

5.Character-Focused Progression
---------------------------------
Each character has a unique storyline or quest, and you can usually only complete one or two per day. This encourages replayability.

6.Item-Based Progression
---------------------------------
Some events or endings can only be unlocked with specific items obtained on previous days, creating a kind of metagame progression.
